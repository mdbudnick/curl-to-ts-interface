# curl-to-ts-interface
Simple script that converts a curl response into a TS interface

# Directions

1. Update the $URL in the ts_interface_from_curl.sh script to the preferred endpoint
2. Run the script
3. Inspect the generated .ts file which will be displayed in stdout e.g. `cat response_1685545461.ts`
4. Any questions with the output can be addressed with the file saved in `/tmp/response.json` from which the Typescript interface is generated
